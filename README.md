# My project is called Delani-Studio

In this project, I was implementing all that I have learned for the past three weeks to create a functional and responsive landing page for a fictional studio. Check it out. I exceeded my expectations to be honest.

This project was done solely by me, Neal Waga. 

It is basically a landing page that lets a user check out a studio and if it is to the person's liking or interest, they can submit their name, contact and leave a message too.
It is super simple to understand and pleasing to the eye.

There are no bugs or issues that would corrupt your system. So do not worry about that.

In this project, I managed to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript for its functionality. 
I also managed to use the jQuery show and hide effect which was pretty cool.
I also used the alert function that lets you, a user, know that your contact information and message has been received.

If you encounter any problems, have questions or want to pitch ideas or suggestions, do not hesitate to reach out and contact me
